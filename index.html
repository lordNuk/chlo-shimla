      <h2>History of Shimla</h2>
      <p>The city of Shimla traces its history back to the 19th century. It was in the year 1804 when the Gurkhas forcefully tried to invade the Himachal region and establish their authority in the surrounding areas of Shimla. By the end of<span class="read-more hide-more">... <a onclick="handleReadMore(event)">read more</a></span><span class=""> 1808, they successfully built many forts from Jamuna to Sutlej and started torturing people residing over there.</span></p>
<span class="">
      <p>Unable to tolerate the mistreatment, the people of Shimla thought of taking help from the Britishers and approached them for the same. The battle which started in the year 1814 came to an end on 15th May 1815 when the Britishers finally defeated Gurkhas and took control of the entire region. The land comprising Shimla today was then given to the Maharaja of Patiala who assisted the Britishers during the war as a reward.</p>
